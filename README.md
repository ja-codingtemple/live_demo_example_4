# Starter Code: Advanced Python Module Project (Defeat the Evil Wizard)

In this repository you have two options for starter code:
1. The folder named ``original_starter_code``: In this folder, all the code is in one file.
2. The folder named ``alternative_starter_code`` In this folder, the code is separated into two files. One contains all the classes, one contains game logic and imports the classes. This example is more complete and is a better head start.

# What you have to do to complete this project
- Implement the heal() method in your Character class.
- Randomize the damage in your attack() method in the Character class.
- Create two custom classes of your choice. These must extend the Character class. This means they must be subclasses of Character.
- Create two special abilities for each custom class you create. Do this by implementing a special_ability() method for your custom classes.
- Make sure to update your create_character() function to return an instance of each of these custom classes when the player selects them.
- Make sure that when the player chooses the heal option that it calls heal()
- Make sure that when the player chooses the special ability option that it calls special_ability()

# To run this program
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open terminal.
3. Navigate into the project folder.
4. Type ``python filename.py`` If the file is called ``alternative_starter_code.py`` you would run ``python alternative_starter_code.py``
